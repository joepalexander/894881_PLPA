<string name="node4Decision1">Grab the gold</string>
<string name="node4Decision2">Use magic</string>

<string name="node5Value">Thinking of all the wide sleeve robes you could buy, you approach the pile of gold. As you make it within a few feet of the gold, the mound growing as more of the cave becomes visible, it stirs suddenly. The gigantic head of a dragon protrudes from the mound of gold, you try to turn back but too late! The dragon having spotted you, raises its head and decimates you with it\'s fiery breath. Your body falls to ash, a fitting death for a greedy thief.</string>

<string name="node6Value">You cast a spell of concealment on yourself and cautiosuly make your way to the pile of gold, more appearing as you see the size of the cave ahead. while observing the mound you realise it\'s moving steadily up and down, a dragon lurks within, waiting to prey on the greedy. You spot light from a tunnel on the other side of the gold.</string>

cases, it is going to be medically unlikely that you are overeating.</string>

  2750 calories??</string>

<string name="node7Decision2">No</string>

<string name="node10Value">From what you have told me, you believe that you
are \"undereating\". The concept of undereating is one that can be very serious to both
your physical and mental health..
We are unable to give any further advice on this matter, but highly recommend that
you consult professional help (whether it be your General Practioner or specialised
psycological help). With the development of this app, we could be adding medically
backed support, so check back in the future!</string>
