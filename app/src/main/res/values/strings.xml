    <string name="node2Value">The next questions are likely to contain the
    requirement for some personal information. This is all anonymous, as well
    as never stored.</string>
    <string name="node2Question">If you had to classify as one or the other; would
    you sugged you feel you are undereating (not eating enough) or
    overeating (eating more than you feel you should)?</string>
    <string name="node2Decision1"> Undereating</string>
    <string name="node2Decision2">Overeating</string>

    <string name="node3Question">Use some magic concealment or grab the gold and leg it?</string>
    <string name="node3Decision1">Grab the gold</string>
    <string name="node3Decision2">Use magic</string>

    <string name="node4Value">Thinking of all the wide sleeve robes you could buy, you approach the pile of gold. As you make it within a few feet of the gold, the mound growing as more of the cave becomes visible, it stirs suddenly. The gigantic head of a dragon protrudes from the mound of gold, you try to turn back but too late! The dragon having spotted you, raises its head and decimates you with it\'s fiery breath. Your body falls to ash, a fitting death for a greedy thief.</string>

    <string name="node5Value">Using the information you have provided me, it is
    is very unlikely that you are overeating. However it is never as easy as just
    diagnosing it. If you feel as if it is having majorly adverse affects on you,
    then booking to see your GP (General Practioner) would most likely be thes best
    course of action. However, i can still provide you with some hopefully helpful
    information.</string>
    <string name="node5Question">Would you like some advice that may help you
    control what you are eating?</string>
    <string name="node5Decision1">Yes</string>
    <string name="node5Decision2">No (finish)</string>

    <string name="node6Value">You consider yourself to be \"overeating\". In most
    cases, it is going to be unlikely that you are overeating.</string>
    <string name="node6Question">Do you consume around or more than 3000 (three thousand)
    calories throughout your average day? (e.g. 7am-8pm)</string>
    <string name="node6Decision1">Yes, i consume around that or more</string>
    <string name="node6Decision2">No, i consume less than the amount</string>

    <string name="nodeMaleValue">Great, now that we have that established,
    I can provide you with some accurate information. Being Male, the NHS suggests
    that you should be attaining a diet of 2500 calories a day. Often people
    recognise a 500 calorie margin above and below for those who are considered
    to be either cutting (trying to lose weight) or bulking (attempting to gain
    weight)</string>
    <string name="nodeMaleQuestion">From the calorie consumption options provided
      below, could you please select the one most accurate for yourself</string>
    <string name="nodeMaleDecision1">1500-2500</string>
    <string name="nodeMaleDecision2">2550+</string>

    <string name="nodeFemaleValue">Great, now that we have that established,
    I can provide you with some accurate information. Being Female, the NHS suggests
    that you should be attaining a diet of 2000 calories a day. Often people
    recognise a 500 calorie margin above and below for those who are considered

    <string name="node10Value">From what you have told me, you believe that you
    are \"undereating\". The concept of undereating is one that can be very serious to both
    your physical and mental health..
    We are unable to give any further advice on this matter, but highly recommend that
    you consult professional help (whether it be your General Practioner or specialised
    psycological help). With the development of this app, we could be adding medically
    backed support, so check back in the future!</string>

    it could benefit you to read up on the NHS\'s literature regarding
